                    <br /><p>I use Linux every single day, seeing as how none of the computers at my house run any other OS&#8217; and I have a laptop for school/work. Being a System76 machine, it runs perfectly for me (with an exception for a couple of Kubuntu Hardy bugs) and I&#8217;m more than happy with it. The problem is that I work in an office using the *other* OS&#8217; and I have to deal with them on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>I entered work and my fellow co-worker in the tech department was having for lack of a better term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death"> &#8220;issues&#8221; </a> with his computer. We had other computers for use in the office so it would be okay once he put in a new hard drive and did a reinstall of Windows over the weekend, he tells me. Note: fourth install of Windows in as many weeks. Near the end of the day, he said something to the extent of &#8216;my hard drive is broken so I cant get that file you need for you.&#8217; Now to be clear, his OS was broken and even his file system was in a bad state, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I couldn&#8217;t get the files I needed. In fact, this sounds like a perfect job for a Linux algorithm.</p>

                    <p>Leson 4: Just because it&#8217;s broke doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s broke. As far as my co-worker knew, his files were completely gone. In fact, the idea of a Live CD was new to him, but I will be giving him one for his own uses so he can learn more. This is why Linux users are encouraged to have a separate /home partition. Extendability and flexibility matter. You OS and file system and kernel and window sessions should never be recursively linked. KDE is acting funny? drop to a shell and hit this to be back in business: sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart<br />

                    Computers are complex, yes. But to imply that one task can break everything on your system is just silly.</p>
                    <p>Lesson 5: OS != computer. As discussed above, a broken file system is inherently different than a bug in GNOME. Or a problem with a misbehaving NIC. Knowing all the parts of a computer and how they work will help you skip all the trouble of trying to troubleshoot and go straight to fixing. Note: I&#8217;m looking at you, &#8220;I need a new computer, my Windows is acting up&#8221;</p>
                    <p>Final thesis: The file we needed was recovered and I dropped some David Copperfield level magic on the office before I came home. And always carry around a flash drive/live cd combo with you to work so any problems with Windows can be easily fixed.</p>
                    <p>Update! Ubuntu Installation complete on the computer in question. +1</p>
